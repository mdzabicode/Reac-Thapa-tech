# Reac-Thapa-tech
I'm going to Start this repo to follow along with Thapa Technical’s React JS series on YouTube. I’ll be adding code, notes, and small projects as I go through each video and learn React step by step.  This is mainly for practice and to track my progress, but feel free to check it out if you're learning too.   Let’s build and grow together!
